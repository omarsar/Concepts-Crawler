# Concepts-Crawler
A set of functions that are useful when dealing with Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects. It also includes some rules that are used to extract some concepts from pieces of text.

Note: Some of the libraries might not need to be imported. This was part of a bigger project so I just took the pieces that were relevant to NLP tasks and didn't have to clean up the libraries list. Anyhow, have fun!!!
